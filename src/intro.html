    Jian Zhou is a second-year MPhil candidate at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), supervised by
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I2hvxPUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Qi Wu</a>.
    <br><br>
    He has a solid background in
    the theoretical foundations of deep learning and Robotics,
    complemented by knowledge in
    control theory and robot kinematics,
    computer vision and 3D reconstruction,
    digital and analog circuits and electrical machinery,
    as well as mechanical structures and mechanics of materials.
    <br>
    He also has experiences on developing radar algorithms for tracking and vital sign detection.
    <br><br>
    His current research interests include imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and the design of
    vision-language-action (VLA) models, with the long-term goal of developing theoretically grounded methods for
    generalist household robots.

    <br><br>
    Prior to this, He has obtained:<br>
    <b>MSc</b> in Robotics and Computation at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL</a><br>
    <b>BEng</b> in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems at the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of
        Liverpool</a>
    and <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en">Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a><br>
